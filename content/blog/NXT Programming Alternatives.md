+++

NXT mindstorms are Lego compatible motors and sensors that are controlled by an intelligent brick. The brick comes with [NXT-G](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/nxt-software-download), a drag and drop style program.

Personally, I do not like NXT-G.

- drag and drop takes a long time
- the way to connect blocks in the program is unusual and difficult to understand
- it is unfamiliar to me

There are a few programming alternatives.

**Update:**

The [BrickPi](https://www.dexterindustries.com/brickpi/) is a great way to motorize LEGOs! It can use Python, Scratch, or C to control NXT motors and could be modded to control any dc motor. Although they require a Raspberry Pi and are a little expensive, the BrickPi is a great way to control your motors.

The first thing we should do is label what we already know. We knew the side lengths of the paper, so let's start with those. One long side is still intact and one short side is folded over, but still whole.

Now we can start figuring out other measurements. The big triangle came from a right angle split evenly in half, so it is a 45° triangle. We know one side of the triangle is length 1, so the other must be as well. We can also use Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse. hypotnuse = √((1)²+(1)²) = √(2). The hypotnuse is √(2), like our long side.
